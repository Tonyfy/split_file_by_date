# split_file_by_date
using the exif information of photo,We get the shooting Angle of the picture,and I implement the photos splitting by shooting date,your can choose splitting via year/month/day/hour/minute/second recursively,thus,when your choose splitting by month,you can get the pictures shooted in same month together.

I use this code for gallery photos' file process before photos' cluster.
